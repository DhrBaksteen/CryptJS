Random Dungeon Generator
========================

An attempt at writing a system for random 3D dungeon generation using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/). Given a set of styling rules the system should be able to generate a believable random dungeon consisting of rooms connected by corridors. Rooms and corridors are constructed from pieces of prefab geometry that are stitched together. Given a set of styling rules variations in walls, textures and other geometry will be made to make the dungeon look more interesting.
